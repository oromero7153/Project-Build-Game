                Princess, Knight, Dragon
This game is a variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors but more dynamic with characters populating the browser. 

The rules are simple:
    The Knight defeats the Dragon with swordsmanship.
    The Princess defeats the Knight with skill and intelligence.
    The Dragon defeats the Princess by kidnapping her. 

The game is player vs the computer. The player will select their character and submit their selection by hitting the "fight" button. This will trigger the computer to select a random character. A function will determine the winner and trigger a statement declaring the winner.
